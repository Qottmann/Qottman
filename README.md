I am interested in simulating quantum many body systems in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry.  
Currently working on [PennyLane](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane) - a cross-platform Python library for differentiable programming of quantum computers.

Recent blog posts:
 * [Differentiable pulse programming with qubits in PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_pulse_programming101.html)  
   TLDR: Introducing pulse programming, that is, manipulating quantum states via the Hamiltonian interactions like on hardware, and running ctrl-VQE.
 * [Differentiating quantum error mitigation transforms](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_diffable-mitigation.html)  
   TLDR: Differentiating *through* error mitigation transforms and proposing to differentiate (hyper) parameters of the transform itself.
 * [Estimating observables with classical shadows in the Pauli basis](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_diffable_shadows.html)  
   TLDR: Unraveling some of mysteries about classical shadows.
 * [Generalization in QML from few training data](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_learning_few_data.html)  
   TLDR: Reproducing the results of [2111.05292](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05292)
